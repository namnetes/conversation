The following code shows how to complete the comment in the COBOL program to call the program Y1HEL4P using "The EXCI CALL interface" :

```
* INSERT CALL TO PROGRAM Y1HEL4P TRANSACTION Y14P

      CALL 'DFHXCIS'                 USING VERSION-1
                                        EXCI-RETURN-CODE
                                        WS-USER-TOKEN
                                        CALL-PROGRAM
                                        WS-PIPE-TOKEN
                                        WS-PROGID
                                        WS-TRANID.
```

The `CALL-PROGRAM` EXCI function is used to call a CICS program. The first parameter is the version of the EXCI interface that is being used. The second parameter is a return code that is used to indicate the success or failure of the call. The third parameter is the user token that was returned by the `INIT-USER` EXCI function. The fourth parameter is the pipe token that was returned by the `ALLOCATE-PIPE` EXCI function. The fifth parameter is the program ID of the CICS program that is being called. The sixth parameter is the transaction ID of the CICS program that is being called.

In this case, the program ID is `Y1HEL4P` and the transaction ID is `Y14P`.

Once the call to the CICS program has been made, the EXCI return code can be checked to determine if the call was successful. If the return code is zero, then the call was successful. If the return code is not zero, then an error occurred. The other EXCI function calls can be used to get more information about the error.

I hope this helps!
